## Internationalization (i18n)

This page demonstrates how to translate certain phrases within embedded marketplace.
The `debug` flag is enabled, which causes all translatable phrases in Prismatic to display the phrase's key.
That way, you can identify which key translates which phrase within the app.

Some phrases are simple key-value strings.
For example, the key `integration-marketplace__filterBar.allButton` affects the button at the top of the marketplace list view screen which lets you toggle between all integrations and only activated integrations. Giving it a value of `"Alle, bitte!"` will cause the button to display "Alle, bitte".

Other phrases are string templates.
For example, `"activateIntegrationDialog.banner.text--isNotConfigurable"` is the helper text that is shown when an integration is not deployable by the customer user.
You can template a dynamic value, like your organization's name, using `%{}` syntax.
i.e. `"activateIntegrationDialog.banner.text--isNotConfigurable": {_: "Veuillez contacter %{organization} pour activer cette int√©gration"}`

Dynamic phrases are phrases that you have specified.
These include integration names, config variable names, config wizard titles and subtitles, etc.
You can translate these phrases by specifying the _exact_ phrase you want to translate, and the string that should replace it.
If your phrase contains HTML you will need to include the entire HTML string (i.e. `"<h1>My Text</h1>": "<h1>New Text</h1>"`)

You can view example code edit this page by modifying `pages/examples/i18n.tsx`.
