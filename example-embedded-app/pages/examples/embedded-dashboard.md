## Customer Dashboard

This page demonstrates how the embed the customer dashboard in your app.
This page uses the `showDashboard()` function to display a dashboard where users can have a holistic view of integrations, instances, executions and more.

This example currently hides the **Attachments** tab from the customer user.
You can choose what tabs to hide by including a `screenConfiguration.dashboard.hideTabs` parameter when you call `showDashboard()`.

You can edit this page by modifying `pages/examples/embedded-dashboard.tsx`.
