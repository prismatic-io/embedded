## Embedded Marketplace with Popover

This page demonstrates how the Prismatic marketplace can open in a popover modal. This page uses the `showMarketplace()` function to display the marketplace with the `usePopover: true` display option.
This is helpful if you would like the marketplace to appear after a user event, like a button click.

You can edit this page by modifying `pages/examples/embedded-marketplace-popover.tsx`.
