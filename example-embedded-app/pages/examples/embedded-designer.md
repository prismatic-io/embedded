## Embedded Designer

This page demonstrates how you can [embed the Prismatic designer](https://prismatic.io/docs/embedded-designer/) into your app, allowing your customers can build integrations for themselves. This page uses the `showIntegrations()` function to display integrations that your customer owns.

To use embedded designer, please ensure that:

1. Your organization has embedded designer enabled (Prismatic support can help you with that).
2. You have enabled embedded designer for the currently logged in customer.

You can edit this page by modifying `pages/examples/embedded-designer.tsx`.
