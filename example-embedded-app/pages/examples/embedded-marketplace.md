## Embedded Marketplace

This page demonstrates how the Prismatic marketplace can be [embedded](https://prismatic.io/docs/embedding-marketplace/) into your app. This page uses the `showMarketplace()` function to display the integrations that you've added to your marketplace for customers to deploy.
This page shows all marketplace integrations, but you can choose to apply [filters](https://prismatic.io/docs/embedding-marketplace/#filtering-integrations) so that only integrations in certain categories or with certain labels are shown.

You can edit this page by modifying `pages/examples/embedded-marketplace.tsx`.
