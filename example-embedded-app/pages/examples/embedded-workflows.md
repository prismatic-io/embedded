## Embedded Workflows

This page demonstrates how you can [embed the Embedded Workflow Builder](https://prismatic.io/docs/embedded-workflow-designer/) into your app, allowing you customers to build workflows for themselves. This page uses the `showWorkflows()` function to display the workflows that your customer owns.

The workflows view allows customers to:

- View all available workflows
- See workflow status (enabled/disabled)
- Add a new workflow
- Load the workflow builder with a selected workflow

You can edit this page by modifying `pages/examples/embedded-workflows.tsx`.
